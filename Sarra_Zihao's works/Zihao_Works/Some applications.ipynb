Stating it differently, do not just apply what we saw during lectures but try to mix all your statistical knowledge to do a great analysis. Good luck!"

Although this dataset is **supervised** in the sense that we also have the information on the variety of wine, i.e., one of **Barolo**, **Grignolino** and **Barbera**, we will act as if it was unsupervised and use this information later on to assess our model performance for classification. There is also an additional feature which the year of production but again this one will be omitted, at least in a first analysis.\n",
