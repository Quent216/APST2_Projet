    "In this lab we will try to feel comfortable with the Expectation Maximization algorithm and its use to fit Gaussian mixture models. To this aim we will start by writing our own EM algorithm for a mixture of univariate Gaussian distributions. We will then complexify our setting by dealing with the multivariate case. We will finally have fun with an application to image segmentation on the first colored picture of Mars sent recently by *Perseverance*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark: Although we will use the GaussianMixture function of Python for this lab, the current version is not as powerfull as (many) R alternative such as packages *mclust* or *Rmixmod*. For instance, such R packages allows for much more covariance structure configurations than the GaussianMixture. If you want to dive seriously into the Gaussian mixture model worlds, these software are top notch!*"
